            Nearly two weeks have passed and <span > <a href="red notice.html" title="Click to watch movie"><b><u>Red Notice</u></b></a></span> is still breaking records. Toasting the success with a glass of Teremana tequila, Dwayne Johnson took to Instagram to reveal that the movie is now the biggest Netflix movie ever, making it a “history making Red Notice Teremana Thanksgiving weekend around the world.” Despite some critical reviews that were none too kind, Johnson touts the high audience score.

            <p class="news_p_font">
                "In just 11 days you’ve officially made Red Notice the BIGGEST Netflix film ever,” Johnson said just ahead of setting the new record. “Shattering all records across the board!!! A global & cultural phenomenon that’s on its way to becoming the most watched Netflix property of all time. Film & Television. Man I’m stunned and humbled by this massive 92% audience score worldwide enjoy our film, my friends.”

                    Netflix invested a lot of money into getting Red Notice made, and it’s paying off in a big way. When the action movie - which stars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds - made its Netflix premiere this month, it was met with instant success. At the time, it was quickly revealed that so many people had tuned in to see the new movie that Red Notice had set the record as the most-watched premiere in Netflix history.
